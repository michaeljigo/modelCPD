This directory holds group-average performance from the ten experiments considered in the manuscript.

The experiment labels are as follows:
   yc98_exp1      Yeshurun & Carrasco, 1998; Experiment 1
   yc98_exp2      Yeshurun & Carrasco, 1998; Experiment 2
   tc02           Talgar & Carrasco, 2002
   clh06          Carrasco, Loula & Ho, 2006
   yc08           Yeshurun & Carrasco, 2008
   ymc08_exp1     Yeshurun, Montagna & Carrasco, 2008; Experiment 1
   ymc08_exp2     Yeshurun, Montagna & Carrasco, 2008; Experiment 2
   ymc08_exp3     Yeshurun, Montagna & Carrasco, 2008; Experiment 3
   ymc08_exp4     Yeshurun, Montagna & Carrasco, 2008; Experiment 4
   bc17           Barbot & Carrasco, 2017

Each experiment's data are held in their respective 'mat' files.

Each file contains:
   - texture images used as input for model optimization
   - performance (d-prime) for neutral and valid (peripheral or central) cueing conditions
   - eccentricities tested
   - best-fitting parameters for the given experiment, for use to test model
